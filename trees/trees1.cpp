/*
when you want to represent a hierarchial structure
for eg : folders in a system 

A tree has many trees inside it and it is called a sbtree
therefore it has a recursive structure

degree of a node is the number of children it has
(immediately below)

internal nodes are the nodes which do not have degree 0 and are not Leaves

Applications
1. Hierarchial data storage
2. Folder Structure
3. XML/HTML content reading 
4. in OOPS - Inheritance 
5. Binary search tree 
6. Binary Heap - used to represent priority queues
7. B and B+ Trees in DBMS
