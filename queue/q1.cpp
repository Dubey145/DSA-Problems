/*
A queue is a first in first out data structure
dequeue  <- 1,2,3,4 <- enqueue 
it is like a pipe

deque() deletes from the front
enqueue() add an element at the rear
getFront() - gets the front item
getRear() - gets last element
size() - gives size
isempty() - returns true if q is empty


Applications : 
1. single resource - multiple consumers
2. synchronization between slow and fast devices
3. Scheduling algorithms 
4. Computer networks - switches / router/ mail queue
5. Variations - Deque, Priority Q and doubly ended priority q
in deque - insertion and deletion at both the end
Priority q - implemented using heaps (doctor-patients analogy) serves more important patient first
